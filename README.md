# Vending-Object-Detection
Code for training a model for detecting objects in a vending machine, as well as code to run a streamlit app to interface with this model. Also included is the YOLO model we trained and used.

The training code gets the dataset from my google drive, which you won't be able to access. If you want to retrain the model, you need the original data zip file - I didn't modify it in any way, other than renaming it in the code.

Also included is a quick demo video of how to use the Streamlit app.
